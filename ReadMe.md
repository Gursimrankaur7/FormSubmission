**iOS Form Submission Assignment**

**Overview**
This project demonstrates a basic iOS app with a form screen that submits user input data to a mock API and displays the response. The focus is on delivering clean UI/UX, modular code architecture, proper error handling, and smooth network integration.

**Project Planning & Timeline**

**Key Modules**
UI/UX: Simple and intuitive form design with input validation and user feedback.

Networking: API integration using URLSession to send data and handle responses.

Error Handling: Clear user messages for network errors or invalid inputs.

Modular Architecture: Clean separation of concerns for maintainability.

Performance: Lightweight UI and efficient network calls for smooth experience.

Testing: Manual testing of main flows and error scenarios.

**Tools, Frameworks, and Libraries**
